IndyGo Route Downloader
=======================

As an bus rider, whenever routes get updated, I find it hard to know which ones are updated, and which ones are staying the same. Call me lazy, but I find it easier just to download all of them when they change, and dump all of them onto my phone.

I could use Google Maps exclusively for routes, but only for routes in the near future. It's handy to keep PDFs of the routes on my phone for knowing when the first/last route is on any given day/weekend/holdiay.

Dear IndyGo,
-----------

Please allow users to download all of your routes as a .zip file, or something.

Sincerely,
