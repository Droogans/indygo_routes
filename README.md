IndyGo Route Downloader
=======================

As an bus rider, whenever routes get updated, I find it hard to know which ones are updated, and which ones are staying the same. Call me lazy, but I find it easier just to download all of them when they change, and dump all of them onto my phone.

Dear IndyGo,
-----------

Please allow users to download all of your routes as a .zip file, or something.

Sincerely,
